Letter Image Recognition Data with Machine Learning Algorithms


TASK: Letter Image Recognition Data
-----------------------------------

In this project, you need to classify 26 capital letters from 16 input values.
The data set contains 20,000 samples, which are the features extracted from
letter images.

Training data set: first 16,000 samples <br />
Testing data set: the remaining 4,000

### Evaluation of Several Machine Learning Algorithms

* Choose at least three Machine Learning Algorithms for evaluation
* Use an existing standard Machine Learning algorithm toolkit, such as WEKA for
  your experiments.
* Evaluate the regression/classification performance / model size trade-off.
  Investigate the tuning potential by adjusting the parameters of your selected
  algorithms.
* Provide figures that explain your findings


Dependencies
